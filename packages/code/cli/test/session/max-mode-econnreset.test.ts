/**
 * Integration tests for the ECONNRESET fix: drive the REAL runCandidate / judge
 * with a mock llm.stream that emits an AI-SDK-style `error` stream PART (the SDK
 * does not throw on transient failures — it yields {type:"error"} then ends the
 * stream normally). These assert that:
 *   1. a transient error part is retried (not silently swallowed),
 *   2. retry uses a fresh accumulator (no duplicated text),
 *   3. a non-transient error part falls through to the catch fallback.
 *
 * The mock stream yields synchronously-constructed events, so the only real
 * wall-clock cost is persistentRetrySchedule's first backoff (~500ms/attempt).
