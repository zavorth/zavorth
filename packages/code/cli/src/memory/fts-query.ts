// Build an FTS5 MATCH expression from a free-form user query.
//
// FTS5's MATCH grammar has its own operators and special characters
// (`"`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `:`, `^`, `-`, `.`, `{`, `}`). Passing a raw user
// string with any of these crashes the parser. Wrapping each token as a
// phrase and joining avoids the crash; OR-join keeps recall high (see
// below).
//
// FTS query normalization for hybrid memory search.
// We tokenize via a Unicode regex that picks contiguous runs of letters,
// numbers, and underscore (everything else becomes a separator), wrap each
// token in phrase quotes, and OR-join. Phrase quotes turn each token into
// a literal-word search that no longer cares about FTS5 special chars.
//
// OR (not AND): AND-join required EVERY query word to appear in a document,
// so a single descriptive word the user added that wasn't in the stored
// text (e.g. "postgres database port 5433" — "database" absent) zeroed the
// whole query even when 6/7 tokens matched. Empirically (80-doc real
// memory) AND returned 0 results for nearly all multi-word queries, even
// 2-word ones like "permission deadlock". OR lets BM25 rank by how many /
// how rare the matched tokens are; the caller applies a score floor to drop
// common-word-only noise (see service.ts searchScoreFloor).
//
// \p{L} includes CJK letters for multilingual recall.
//
// Returns null when no usable tokens are extracted. Callers should treat
// that as "empty query, no results" without sending the query to SQL.
