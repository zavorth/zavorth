// script's own file IO — distinct from the file-tool boundary of the agents it
// spawns (which have the same lexical posture, so this grants no new reach).
//
// LIMITATION (by design, experimental): the check is NAME-based, not realpath —
// `Filesystem.contains` is purely lexical and does NOT resolve symlinks. A
// pre-existing symlink INSIDE the workspace that points OUTSIDE it (e.g. a pnpm
// store link under node_modules) is therefore NOT caught: a path through it
// resolves to an in-root lexical string, passes this check, and the underlying
// fs op follows the link out of the jail. Hardening to a true boundary means
// realpath-ing the resolved path (and, for writeFile, the leaf's parent) before
// the contains check — deferred until the feature graduates off the flag.
