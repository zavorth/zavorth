/**
 * The single write-permission gate for file-mutating tools (edit, write,

 *   1. external_directory — asks before touching paths outside the worktree
 *      (defers the memory subtree to the memory guard; see the early return above).
 *   2. memory-path-guard — finer authority over the memory tree: a task-bound
 *      subagent may write its own tasks/<taskId>/*.md, the checkpoint-writer its
 *      canonical paths, and everything else is rejected.
 *
 * Collapsing both into one call removes the per-tool duplication and, more
 * importantly, makes "call external_directory but forget the memory guard"
 * unrepresentable — a new write tool that calls this one gate cannot drift into
 * leaving the memory tree unguarded. Read-only tools (read/grep/glob/lsp) keep
 * calling assertExternalDirectoryEffect directly; the memory guard is write-only.
