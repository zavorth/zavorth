# Zavorth Bootstrap

This document is the versioned starting path for a fresh Zavorth workspace. It is product guidance, not mutable runtime configuration or a live policy engine.

## Start

1. Configure providers and the local workspace:

   ```bash
   zavorth setup
   ```

2. Start the governed runtime:

   ```bash
   zavorth start
   ```

3. Open the Desktop or the official Control surface:

   ```bash
   zavorth open
   ```

   The web entry is available at `/control` on the local runtime.

4. Ask naturally in the app, or begin from the terminal:

   ```bash
   zavorth chat
   ```

Sensitive actions remain behind explicit approvals. Completed work produces receipts so the same run can be reviewed from Desktop, Control, or CLI/TUI.

## Readiness

Use `zavorth status` for a concise state summary and `zavorth doctor` for guided repair. Provider credentials belong in the configured secure store, never in this file.
